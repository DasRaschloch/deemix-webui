			This app uses the <a href="https://deemix.app" target="_blank">deemix</a> library, you can use this
			library to make your own UI for deemix.</br>
			Here's the <a href="https://notabug.org/RemixDev/deemix" target="_blank">official repo</a> for the
			library.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to rtonno, uhwot and lollilol for helping me with this project.<br>
			Also thanks to BasCurtiz and <a href="http://linktr.ee/scarvimane" target="_blank">scarvimane</a> for
			making the icon.

		<h1>Bug Reports</h1>
		<p>
			If you have questions or problems with the app, search for a solution in the
			<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deemix" target="_blank">subreddit</a> first and then, if you don't
			find anything
			you can make a post with your issue on the subreddit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before reporting a bug make sure you're running the latest version of the app and that the thing you
			want
			to report is actually a bug and not something that's wrong only on your end.<br />
			Make sure the bug is reproducible on another machines and also <b>DO NOT</b> report a bug if it's been
			already reported.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>DO NOT</b> open issues for asking questions, there is a subreddit for that.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Donations</h2>
		<h3>You want to contribute to this project? You can do that <b>in different ways!</b></h3>
		<p>
			If you're fluent in python you could try to make a new UI for the app using the base library, or fix
			bugs in the library with a pull request on the <a href="https://notabug.org/RemixDev/deemix"
				target="_blank">repo</a>.<br>
			I accept features as well, but no complex things, as they can be implementend directly in the app and
			not the library.</p>
		<p>
			If you're fluent in another programming language you could try to port deemix into other programming
			languages!<br>
			You need help understanding the code? Just hit RemixDev up on Telegram or Reddit.</p>
		<p>If you know JavaScript, HTML or CSS you could contribute to the <a
				href="https://notabug.org/RemixDev/deemix-webui" target="_blank">webui</a>.</p>
		<p>
			If you find some bugs you can report them in the repo, just make sure your bug isn't something that
			only
			affects you and it can be reproducible by other users as well.<br>
			Duplicate bug reports will be closed, so keep an eye out on that.</p>
